Now, people that know me would say I'm quite serious and pretty blunt with his opinions. I mean, it's sort of true. I'm a blunt guy. I only say bad things, when it is to make a point. However no one wants to be around, hang around, or work with a negative nancy. 

Well to put it into perspective, if you are talking with a person who usually complains, and paints things or others in a bad light that negativity spills onto you. This is why I think it's better to have a positive perspective/spin on the things we say. You wouldn't enjoy conversation or being around a person who just complains and talks bad about others.

I'll show an example of a negative statement, then put a positive twist to it.

Now let's see... There are plenty of real life experiences I could talk about. However I'm going to go with something hypothetical, in this point of my life, if something is bad and I have nothing good to say about it, I rather say nothing at all. Besides, there are some things we shouldn't disclose, to save face.

Let's go with an example of a breakup with an ex. You meet this person, (if your a girl, on a date, a guy, just chatting), maybe start chatting on past, and exes. Well something went wrong with this guy's previous relationship.

Well alright hell, this little story isn't true, but it is quite full of negativity, and paints the guy, and his ex-girlfriend in a very bad light. Imagine just sitting for drinks with someone you just met, and he pours this out. Both guys and girls would know hes insecure, a complainer, not in his center, a negative nancy and a person who can't really read a situation, and would generally not be fun to hang out with.

If this guy wants to tell a similar story it needs to come off a little nicer. He can still tell the truth. He needs to highlight the positive aspects, know how to turn around the bad parts into parts of self-reflection and talk about parts on what he can do to improve and what he got out of this experience.

Haha, well this situation I gave myself was quite challenging but a fun exercise to shape into a positive writeup. Anyways, the message here is that it's all about perspective on your experiences. Yes, there are the bad points that you have, but you will have to phrase those things in a way to not come off as a downer. Also, we wouldn't just use this when talking with people, but life in general, we have to look at the positive side of things.
