I suppose it is due time for a guy so deep in thought, but also so dedicated to his craft to have a personal portfolio and blog. I'm a pretty direct guy, so look forward to my hobbies, code, work, personal, struggles/hardships, relationships, thoughts on society, and the inspirations and philosophies I live by.

I'm still early on in my journey called life, but to go far, I want us to go together.
