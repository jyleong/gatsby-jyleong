What is "[Amor Fati"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBeJfprKSyw)?

This statement literally translates to the "Love of Fate". It is a philosophical concept noted by Marcus Aurelius and Friedrich Nietzsche to acknowledge things that are happening outside of our control. The idea is to love and embrace whatever happens, no matter the outcome, desired or not. Applying this in the context of working towards a goal is to hone a sense of indifference to the goal. Instead focusing on the flow state of the task.

Being in this detached state gives us the most control over ourselves. Unblocking our headspace into things beyond our control.

#### Through the lens of the world

With everything going on I am trying to make sense of the matters. However distant some current events are, their effects echo... eventually rippling down to us.

Needless to say I have not taken my own advice very well staying away from social media, news and what not.

I frustrated with myself that I have allowed to be easily riled up and I am feeling anxiety seeing the world continue to crumble.

In a sense what is happening now this is the law of the universe and fate. C'est la Vie or such is life.

I am only allowing myself to be upset over these matters.

As you can see, in practice applying "Amor Fati" is difficult.

It is simple to say just let go, accept what is going on, but do not be apathetic about it. Instead it is to learn from what is happening to understand how to prevent it from happening again. At the individual case we have to control our position knowing the outcome, again putting the onus of control over ourselves. How can we live and act knowing that X is happening.

If anything, now is the time to put all the Stoic learnings into practice. Amor Fati is to frame everything happening in ones life all the good times, all the bad times as good or at least necessary. Such is life.

It's just the way that it is. Life just is.
