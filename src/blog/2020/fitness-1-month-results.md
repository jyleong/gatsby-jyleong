After a month of training and eating, (which involved a modification in the plan midway) I decided to record my physical measurements. Those are the measurements regarding my body mass and the weights used for Occam's protocol.

Absent minded that I am, I forgot to include the initial starting measurements to my first post! They are recorded here in my notebook. For sake of readability and comparison I will have them here.

**It is important to measure and track your progress for goals**

Measuring progress is important if we want to positive effects such as reinforced habits, accountability, visual representation of said progress and the emotional feeling of getting closer to your goals.

I admit that this time around I did not do a good job showing my starting point. So I though that this short post is the right place to include this detail.

From the last update my fitness goals shifted drastically. From losing weight and lean cutting to more of a mental performance boost and preserving my strength and muscle mass. Those are still loose goals.

**Let's define the parameters of my goals:**

- Increase mental clarity, focus and acuity
- Have the cardio vascular ability to run 10 km in under 50 minutes
- Remain the same weight as I did before, while increasing strength and muscle mass

Measuring progress for the first point is trickier.... For ketosis that could be measured by checking my blood ketone levels. That could tell whether my body is running on ketones rather than glucose, which indirectly signals that my brain is running on ketones.

However I do not have that equipment on hand nor do I have the funds to do so.

Instead I gauge this by my overall feeling each day and week.

The following two points are pretty easy to gauge. With running I can always compare my time and distance ran with each previous session. Also checking how I energetic I feel after a run.

The last bit is the purpose of this post -

Thankfully these are positive progress points. To note, interesting that my chest size decreased and my left bicep sized increased by a whole 1.5 cm whereas the right side stayed the same. There is a possibility the measurement was not done accurately. Next time I will double check.

_Look at those gainsssss in just under 2 weeks!_

To be honest I do not think I am performing the Drag bar curls properly. It felt like the biceps weren't engaged at all, therefore reflecting the high starting and current numbers. Once done 'properly' I suspect my actual working weight will be lower.

Other things to note is that the Yates row and pull downs are already far too difficult. There are two options, continue at this working weight until comfortable or decreasing them by a small amount.

_Until next time, thanks for following my updates. Again, apologies for not showing any stats before. What do you have to track in order to reach your fitness and other personal goals?_
