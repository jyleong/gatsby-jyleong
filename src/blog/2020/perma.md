_The theoretical model of happiness PERMA by Martin Seligman postulates certain crucial elements to reach happiness_. _You can read about this theory in [detail](https://positivepsychology.com/perma-model/)_

#### Each letter in the PERMA acronym corresponds with an element:

- **P:** Positive Emotion - on feeling good and and obvious point about happiness
- **E:** Engagement - partaking in activities that keep us in a focused/flow state. This is usually an activity that challenges a person intellectually or physically that invokes some forward progression
- **R:** Relationships - emphasizing on the quality and authenticity of personal connections. Human beings should strive for health relationships with friends, family, groups in some community
- **M:** Meaning - Human beings also feel the need to be a part of something and a view on life as to how to best 'live it'. This is explained in a form of spirituality and religion
- **A:** Achievement/Accomplishments - Setting, working towards and attaining goals set out in life. Setting realistic goals that just stretch an individuals boundaries and limits keeps us engaged and thriving.

#### Great... Now what do these hippy woo-woo idea relate to Paced Progress other hippy woo-woo ideas?

Haha my friend, it has everything to do with FIRE/Stoicism/Minimalism!

After I did some serious reflections and visualizations of what I wanted in my life (First identified by Jordan Peterson's [Future authoring program](https://www.selfauthoring.com/future-authoring)) I came to realize each individual does not require much to be content nor happy. It was the process of figuring out what _was_ important to me that was key.

This program of identifying my values and direction so closely mirrors the main points in the PERMA model that is was almost uncanny. These life philosophies I try to embody (FIRE/Stoicism/Minimalism) are also a means to an end of how to find meaning and fulfillment.

Think of it this way: for minimalism it is an audit of all the possessions that you own that provide actual value for your life. It is a form of intentional living and conscious consumerism. Leading into the principles of understanding my physical desires. To obtain those desired I educated myself on saving, investing, growing my income that closely aligned with FIRE principles.

My practices of life philosophies or systems of practice and thought Buddhism and Stoicism are guidelines of how I choose to live life and the lens of how to view the world, trying to make sense of it all.

#### It sounds new-agey but is is all about a mindset shift:

Once I achieve my _so called FIRE goals_ life wouldn't just stop. I would not sit at a beach all day in my mid-30's. You still have to do _something_ and keep yourself engaged. Instead, being financially free means that I am free to do almost anything that I want without financial worry. Realizing this is another part of intentional living. With the freedom we have the choice to back away from comprising situations against our values. With the free time we begin to truly live life on our terms.

For the FIRE path it is important to identify what is part of our ideal lifestyle first. Planning out our lives were a requirement for FIRE mental exercises and a big part of JBP's authoring program. After identifying the lifestyle we create a plan and execute on the path to achieve FIRE.

Coupling a FIRE mindset with the Future Authoring exercises drove me to the same core important points of PERMA. I came into studying philosophies and religions of Stoicism and Buddism because I knew that everyone needed some sort of moral and ethical framework to build themselves on top of and have some sort of highest principle to believe in.

#### For myself it was confirming the important tenants of my life and why they were important to me:

- Doing things that gave me personal happiness at times (eg: activities, hobbies), whatever invokes this emotion (Positive Emotion)
- Finding some craft skill that keeps me engage (for me that is the constructive hobbies of coding, writing, reading/learning, physical challenges, general skill building) - (Engagement)
- Knowing who is important in my life and worthy of developing relationships with (Parents, Partner, close friends, potential future family) - (Relationships)
- Trying to make sense of this world and my place in it, I am still integrating the practical philosophies and religions of Stoicism and Buddhism to my life - (Meaning)
- The main focus of this blog, trying out new things and documenting them, showing my personal history and progression over time - (Achievement/Accomplishment)
