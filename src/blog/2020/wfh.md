_Update: So far in Canada we are forced to self isolate and maintain social distancing to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus so that our healthcare system will not be flooded with cases._

I must be thankful that my line of work is not affected so much and truly fortunate that I have the flexibility to work from home. In fact the company I work for makes the business tools that allow for working remotely. If you are interested in this solution reach out to me and I could provide some info.

I can understand that others are facing challenges when it comes to their stress, anxiety and productivity levels when working at home.

From previous experiences I have grown accustomed to working from home, so this situation isn't abnormal for me. However I do enjoy working at the office, but well we have to do our part to flatten the curve.

##### Working from home challenges:

**Distraction**: Especially in these times that we have 24/7 access to the internet and consequently the news we are so easily distracted.  
  
**Laziness**: Also, since we are at home we are in a more comfortable space, more comfortability while trying to work leads to behaviours of slacking off.  
  
**Eating habits**: I am sure now more tempting snacks and foods are closer in proximity to you, now its ok to feed when you are hungry. Usually at office type work we are burning less calories, but now in forced quarantine we are cut out from a lot of activity. I am sure you also have some naughty sugar-y, highly processed snacks : P eating those would make you feel pretty uncomfortable.

**Angst of being forced to stay in:** Humans are by nature social creatures. It is fine every now and then to work from home when there are others things that come up that need your attention. Those cases are when it was our choice to work from home. This time it is different, having this enforced upon us brings this sense of looming uncertainty in the back of our minds as we are trying to work.

In light of these challenges are some tips to remain calm and productive for remote working!

##### Work productivity:

1. Have a neat and organized desk space. We are aiming to minimize distractions here. Apply a sense of minimalism for your workspace. Have only what is necessarily needed for your job. Clean up around the space in order to achieve mis-en-place. When the space is decluttered it also declutters your mind.
2. About screens, limit access to extra tabs or monitors. At home I work near my computer tower with extra monitors, I often get distracted browsing youtube, messengers, the news... overall too many other windows open with notifications. If your work doesn't required external monitors, let's say for research, than limit those. In fact, I have found that having all my code on one screen forced me to focus on my tasks at hand, it takes a lot of effort to CTRL+Tab and open up other screen for browsing if I am limited to my screen real estate.
3. Set a routine when working from home. (That includes getting up, showering and putting on clothes other than your PJ's for work) With a lack of structure we tend to procrastinate or put off our work. When we come back to things as normal this disruption in our routine is difficult to incorporate back. So aim to set a schedule during this unforeseen period of forced remote working so that you can have expectations to your day.
4. Provide clear communication to your coworkers, if anything over communicate. You will want to set your boundaries WFH and also let other's know on what you are up to. Whether you are at lunch, out to get your groceries for the day of otherwise pre-occupied.
5. Schedule breaks! That being said these are interesting times to say the least, we should find the balance to stay updated but know our limits. Try to time block focused work and a small free internet break if you do need so. Back in school while Iw as studying I practiced blocking out segments of study with the [Pomodoro Technique](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730). Give this a try!

##### Health-wise:

1. Stay hydrated with good liquids such as tea or water. It is a better alternative than sugary drinks or alcohol. Many far more scientifically inclined people will speak to the increase of focus and mental clarity. I can say that drinking lots of fluids will also encourage you to take natural bathroom breaks.
2. More on health, during a quarantine try to continue eating healthfully. I don't have much of a problem with groceries aside from consumer staples because I buy whole, unprocessed foods and cook up meals in bulk. They should last for a good while and keep me properly nourished.
3. More on health - Get moving! The gyms are closed but that is not an excuse to not get moving, we need to get the blood flowing so we remain fit and focused. Try out some HIIT routines and home body weight workouts. Even some things during breaks like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, squats would help.

##### Avoiding feelings of isolation:

1. Find some method for interactions with your coworkers. With the tool we make we can facilitate remote/virtual meetings. Such as virtual office lunches or virtual game night
2. Get some meaningful relaxation/leisure time! We will be at our computers all day. When we finish our work we are still in our home office. _Go do something else besides video games, browsing or messages catchup_. Go practice meditation, go call and catchup with a friend/family member and see how they are doing. Possibly go outside for a brisk walk\* (Remember to use caution with social distancing)

Alright crew, stay safe out there! Woops! Indoors. Remember, this crisis is something that we each have the opportunity of individual action to mitigate. Please keep doing your part.
