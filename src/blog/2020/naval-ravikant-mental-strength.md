Recently I revisited the wisdom gem of [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval) through the collected curations of his wisdoms over the past decaded packaged in the aptly named [Navalmanack](https://www.navalmanack.com/). 

I find this guy's mind fascination. Simply said, that I like the way he thinks, articulates and expresses himself.

Currently I read a page of this and ponder on it for the rest of the day.

Particularly this past week his descriptions on meditations are what I want to convey to others to get them onboard this practice.

_Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind._

The real takeaway from meditation should be the ability to sit still in an undisturbed space and not let the eventual thoughts that spiral out of control in your mind to influence you. It should be the exercise that brings your mind back to the present and in the moment, since a lot of our suffering comes from either thinking ahead or thinking in the past. 

I also like how he analogizes meditation to dieting, there is not one-size fits all method of the practice but you'll have to explore different methods until you find something that works for you and stick to a regimen.

Whether that may be Transcendental meditation, Vipassana, breathing techniques, mindfulness or what have you.

Any activity that isolates your mind, brings you live, be present 'in the moment' and something that you do purely for self fullfiling purposes are considered forms of meditation.

The last section of that blogpost was really resonnant to me.

_Hiking is walking meditation._
_Journaling is writing meditation._
_Praying is gratitude meditation._
_Showering is accidental meditation._
_Sitting quietly is direct meditation._

There are plenty more of his practical wisdom's I'm still 'meditation' on myself - hah. Especially his take on business, money and future predictions.

All of it's content is for free to read on the [web](https://www.navalmanack.com/) or as a download, you can even purchase a physical copy.
