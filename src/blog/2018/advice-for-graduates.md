Taken from Dr. Jordan B. Peterson's video and from 12 rules for life [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JfIbRdUfSU)

First of all, congratulations to the graduating class of 2018! You have achieved something great! At the same time, you are thrusted into the real world with bright eyes... Now, what is next?
This is significant event, like JBP says, it is an end and a beginning at the same time. 

From my experience, after graduation, from this new found freedom there is even more unknown and possibility. We can take a step back and reflect for a moment. This guidance is general, but thoughtful and realistic enough to apply to all types of graduates.

Advice I take from Jordan Peterson himself: Always aim higher, always strive to make yourself better, surround yourself with people that will bring you up and want the best for you.

Another good point from his brief video: We usually phrase the question of "What do you wanna be/do now after graduating?" This is usually phrased as what career field you want to pursue. It should really be simplified: What sort of person do you want to become or continue to be? A good person, a responsible adult. That is the basis of what we should strive to become.

Once you figure out how to do this, you can have a meaningful, productive, honest life. As said from the Dr. himself.

If you are curious about the rules or Jordan Peterson himself, I encourage you to explore his lectures. Here is an amazon link to the [12 rules for life](https://www.amazon.ca/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529173507&sr=8-1&keywords=12+rules+for+life+an+antidote+to+chaos).
