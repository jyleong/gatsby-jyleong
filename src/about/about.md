Hey there, I'm James. Currently a software engineer living and working _remotely_ in Vancouver. Outside of the standard Computer Science education I've received from [SFU](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html). I've found myself a peculiar position working with deskphone hardware reinventing common enterprise VoIP services at [Dialpad](https://dialpad.com).

I don't want to be stereotyped as a socially inept code monkey, in fact I have many thoughts, questions and interests in multiple topics. Enough to justify sharing them under scrutiny using this little space on the internet.

Here you'll find a mix of entries cataloguing such as the learnings from coding, personal progress/achievements on other endeavors or thoughts and interpretations on philosophies and other topics that interest me.

Particularly the ideas I resonate with are Stoicism, Buddhism and a personal growth/enlightenment mindset. Hence the self-labelled _Stoic Software Engineer_.

Going by these practices I try to be a more intentional, insightful, introspective less shitty version of myself day by day.

### Contact Me

If you're a recruiter or just simply looking to connect I can be reached email at [james.leong94@gmail.com](mailto:james.leong94@gmail.com)! Or you can take a look at my [resume](/resume/).

Perhaps we could work together! Discuss random ideas, ask questions around coding, Software Engineering or simply to connect. :)
